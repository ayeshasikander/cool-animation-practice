# Front-End Practice Project with GSAP Timeline

This project is a simple front-end web application designed for practice purposes. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), particularly focusing on GSAP's new feature, the Timeline. The project is aimed at helping you gain experience with web animation and timeline control using GSAP.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a basic web page with animations and interactive elements using GSAP's Timeline. The primary objectives are as follows:

1. Create a visually appealing webpage with HTML and CSS.
2. Use JavaScript and GSAP's Timeline to add animations to elements on the page.
3. Implement interactivity by triggering animations based on user interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you start working on this project, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Knowledge of GSAP and its basic usage. If you're new to GSAP, you can check out the official [GSAP documentation](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP) to get started.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any other of your choice).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayeshasikander/cool-animation-practice.git
   cd gsap-timeline-practice
   ```

2. **Open the Project:**

   Open the project directory in your chosen code editor.

3. **Structure:**

   The project structure may look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   gsap-timeline-practice/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css
   â”œâ”€â”€ js/
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ script.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
   â””â”€â”€ images/
   ```

4. **Start a Local Server:**

   To view your project, it's recommended to run a local development server. You can use tools like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in Visual Studio Code or Python's built-in HTTP server.

5. **Code and Experiment:**

   Open `index.html`, `css/style.css`, and `js/script.js` in your code editor. Customize and experiment with the code to create your animations and interactive elements using GSAP's Timeline.

## Usage

In this project, you'll find examples of how to create a GSAP Timeline and apply animations to different elements. You can experiment with and modify the following parts of the code:

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Define the structure of your web page.

- **CSS (`css/style.css`):** Style the elements as desired.

- **JavaScript (`js/script.js`):** Implement GSAP animations and interactivity. You'll find code examples for creating a GSAP Timeline and adding animations to elements.
